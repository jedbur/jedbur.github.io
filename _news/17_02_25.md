Happy to share new work with Sergii Strelchuk, in which we analyse previously unstudied properties of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distributions. By building a superoperator formalism for KD distributions, we were able to isolate the set of unitary operations which preserves KD-positivity, and apply the well-known algorithm for classical simulation via quasiprobabilities of [Pashayan, Wallman and Bartlett](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07525) to the KD setting. This leads to very interesting behaviour not seen in the discrete Wigner function -- a quantum state may be KD-positive throughout its evolution, yet take exponentially long to simulate. The full paper is available online: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11784](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11784).
