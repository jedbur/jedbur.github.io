The work from the first year of my PhD, titled "A Lightweight Protocol for Matchgate Fidelity Estimation" has finally been released on arXiv! In the paper, Dr Sergii Strelchuk and I present a new method for estimating the fidelity of Matchgate circuits, based on a popular direct fidelity estimation algorithm of Steven Flammia and Yi-Kai Liu. The full paper is available online: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07974](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07974).
