Happy to share that I've recently joined Quantinuum as a summer intern, working with the Quantum Chemistry team under the supervision of Dr Nathan Fitzpatrick. 

I will go back to doing my PhD in October. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to learning more about quantum computational chemistry, and making my own contributions to the team!
