This short post is intended to help Cambridge Physics IA students understand why we phasors, how to use them, and how to derive the correct expressions for diffraction pattern intensities that you learn about in the Waves &amp; Quantum Waves lecture course. You can think of it as a supplement to the lecture notes (available <a href="/assets/pdf/Interference_and_Diffraction.pdf">here</a>). I recommend you read that first. I also recommend <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/326455/question-on-wave-interference/326469#326469">this post on StackExchange</a>, on which parts of this write-up are based.</p> <p>After a refresher on what a phasor is, we will use them to derive expressions for diffraction intensities for the following cases:</p> <ul> <li>One Point Source</li> <li>Double Slits (Two Point Sources)</li> <li>Diffraction Grating (Multiple Point Sources)</li> <li>Single-Slit Diffraction (Infinitely Many Point Sources)</li> <li>Double Slits with Finite Width</li> </ul> <p>In addition to phasor derivations, we will also see how to derive the final two expressions via integration.</p> <p> </p> <h4 id="why-phasors">Why Phasors?</h4> <p>Whilst using phasors makes sense for circuit theory (especially when dealing with an alternating current), it is not completely clear why you would want to use them for working out a diffraction pattern. The basic reason why is that it lets us bypass long algebraic derivations with diagrams, and relate finding the intensity at a point on a screen to graphically ‘connecting’ arrows with different orientations and lengths. Since phasors are complex numbers (which are vectors), this describes the effect of constructive &amp; destructive interference of waves from multiple sources arriving at a point on a screen.</p> <p>You should know that a wave \(\psi\) is described by an expression of the form \(\psi = A\cos(\omega t - k x)\). Just like for AC circuits in electronics, we will introduce a complex variable \(Z = Ae^{i(\omega t - k x)}\), and set \(\psi = \text{Re} (Z)\). Thus, we can obtain interference effects by adding up a bunch of complex numbers and taking their real part. We will later see that in practice it is easier to just consider the modulus \(\| Z \|\) and square it to obtain the intensity.</p> <p> </p> <h4 id="one-point-source">One Point Source</h4> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="70%" height="70%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>To make this more concrete, let’s initially consider a single wave coming from a <em>point source</em> (of infitesimally small width, so we don’t get single-slit diffraction), and pick some point on a screen at a distance \(x\). We then consider the amplitude of this wave: it is going to be given to us by \(A\cos(\omega t - k x)\). Our phasor is complex number \(Z\), and the amplitude of the wave is then the real part of \(Z\). You can see this (as a function of \(x\) and \(t\)) in the <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/682250aedfbd11d87f25bbae">animation below</a>:</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-2.gif-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-2.gif-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-2.gif-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-2.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="60%" height="60%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Notably, if we set \(x = r\) and vary \(t\), it will give us the amplitude at some point \(r\) away as a function of time. On the other hand, if we set \(t = t'\) then the graph of \(\text{Re}(Z)\) against \(x\) gives us the amplitude of the arriving wave on the whole screen at some instant in time \(t'\). We could then transform the resulting graph into one of amplitude vs. angular displacement by substituting for \(x\) using \(R = x \sin \theta\).</p> <p>In a diffraction experiment, however, we are interested in the <em>intensity</em> (i.e. brightness) rather than amplitude of the arriving waves. The intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude as \(I \propto \psi^2\), or in terms of our phasor \(I \propto \text{Re}(Z)^2\). We also tend to not care about the time-dependence, meaning we average it out when finding the expression for intensity. So we can calculate the time-averaged intensity \(\bar{I}(x)\) from a <em>point source</em> as:</p> \[\bar{I}(x) \propto \frac{1}{T} \int^T_0 A^2 \cos^2(\omega t - k x) dt \propto \frac{A^2}{2}\] <p>In other words, for a point source every position on the screen receives the same intensity of light, which makes sense as there are no interference effects.</p> <p> </p> <h4 id="two-slits-two-point-sources">Two Slits (Two Point Sources)</h4> <p>The two slit diffraction pattern is the result of waves from <em>two point sources</em> arriving at the screen, where there is now interference caused by a difference in the lengths travelled from the sources to the screen. We have two phasors \(Z_1= A_1 e^{i(\omega t_1 - k r_1)}\) and \(Z_2= A_2 e^{i(\omega t_2 - k r_2)}\), and the amplitude of the resulting wave is given by \(\text{Re}(Z) = \text{Re}(Z_1 + Z_2)\). I have changed the \(x\) coordinates to \(r\) for consistency with the lecture notes.</p> <p>Here, we make some assumptions: \(R\) is much larger than the slit spacing \(d\), so the distances from the two point sources to the screen are are \(r_1 = r\), and \(r_2 \simeq r + d \sin \theta\). We will also say that the waves leave the two point sources at the same time, so \(t_1 = t_2 = t\), and their individual amplitudes are the same giving \(A_1 = A_2 = A\). Our phasor at the point of angular displacement \(\theta\) is therefore given by:</p> \[Z_1 + Z_2 = Ae^{i(\omega t - k r)} + Ae^{i(\omega t - k(r + d \sin \theta))} = Ae^{i(\omega t - k r)} (1 + e^{- i k d \sin \theta})\] <p>At this point you would usually draw \(Z\) and use the cosine rule to derive the expression for \(I(\theta)\), but we will first proceed algebraically. We can again take the real part of this expression, which will be given by:</p> \[\text{Re}(Z) = A \cos (\omega t - k r) + A \cos (\omega t - k(r + d \sin \theta)) = 2A \cos (\omega t - kr + \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) \cos ( \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta)\] <p>Thus, the time-averaged intensity is given by:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \bar{I}(\theta) &amp;\propto \frac{4A^2}{T} \int^T_0 \cos^2 (\omega t - kr + \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) \cos^2 ( \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) dt \\ &amp;\propto 2A^2 \cos^2 ( \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) + \frac{2A^2}{T} \cos^2 ( \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) \int^T_0 \cos (2\omega t - 2kr + kd \sin \theta) dt \\ &amp;\propto 2A^2 \cos^2 ( \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) \end{aligned}\] <p>Again, averaging the expression with respect to time has ‘flushed out’ the terms dependent on \(\omega t - kr\). In principle, you could calculate an integral like this for any number of slits, but the point of this article is to show you how to avoid doing so.</p> <p> </p> <h4 id="using-phasors">Using Phasors</h4> <p>Notice that in the previous expression for \(Z_1 + Z_2\) we have split up the complex number into a product of two complex numbers. When the number of slits increases we will always be able to do this, and the phasor \(Z = Z_1 + Z_2 + ... + Z_N\) will factor into \(e^{i(\omega t - kr)}\) (which I will call the <em>overall phase</em>) and \(Z(\theta)\):</p> \[Z = e^{i(\omega t - kr)} \times Z(\theta)\] <p>Since \(Z(\theta)\) is another complex number, we can write it in polar form as \(Z(\theta) = e^{i \alpha} \sqrt{I(\theta)}\), where \(\sqrt{I(\theta)}\) is the ‘length’ of the phasor, and \(e^{i \alpha}\) is some additional phase. Since \(t\) in our overall expression is arbitrary, we can (without loss of generality) absorb this into the overall phase (setting \(t \rightarrow t - \frac{\alpha}{\omega}\)) to obtain:</p> \[Z = e^{i(\omega t - kr)} \times \sqrt{I(\theta)}\] <p>Finally, when we draw out a phasor for \(Z\) this will be given by some arrow of length \(\sqrt{I(\theta)}\) initially at an angle \(\omega t - kr\) to the origin, which then rotates counterclockwise with \(t\) increasing. Notice that for some value of \(t\) (i.e. \(t = \frac{kr}{\omega}\)) the amplitude will be equal to the length of this arrow, i.e. \(- \| Z \| \leq \text{Re}(Z) \leq \| Z \|\). So we can think of the modulus of \(Z\) as a bound for the amplitude of the wave observed at \(\theta\), and its square as a bounding value for the intensity. Time averaging the intensity will then give a value proportional to this bound, so we can just calculate \(\| Z \|\) to identify \(I(\theta)\).</p> <p>The upshot of the above is that we can find the square root of the intensity from the length of the resulting phasor \(Z\), and we can then find the intensity from taking the modulus square \(\| Z \|^2\). We can then find the time-averaged intensity from \(\bar{I}(\theta) = \frac{I(\theta)}{2} = \frac{\| Z \|^2}{2}\).</p> <p>Let’s try this for the double slit. The modulus of \(Z\) is given by:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \| Z \| &amp; = \sqrt{ A^2 (1 + e^{-ikd \sin \theta } ) (1 + e^{ikd \sin \theta } ) } \\ &amp; = \sqrt{A^2(2 + e^{ikd \sin \theta } + e^{-ikd \sin \theta } )} \\ &amp; = A \sqrt{2} \sqrt{1 + \cos (kd \sin \theta)} \\ &amp; = A \sqrt{2} \sqrt{2 \cos^2 (\frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta) } \\ &amp; = 2A \cos ( \frac{1}{2} kd \sin \theta ) \end{aligned}\] <p>Which returns the correct expression for \(\bar{I}(\theta)\). Finally, we could have avoided all of this algebra by following the derivation given in the lecture notes, i.e. drawing out the phasor and using the cosine rule to find the length of the \(Z\) (given by the red line in the diagram):</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="70%" height="70%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p> </p> <h4 id="diffraction-gratings-n-point-sources">Diffraction Gratings (\(N\) Point Sources)</h4> <p>We can use our method for finding the expression for \(I(\theta)\) when there are multiple slits present. Algebraically, this means we have \(Z = Z_0 + ... + Z_{N-1}\), and \(Z_m = Ae^{i(\omega t - kr - m \delta)}\), where \(\delta = kd \sin \theta\). This gives us the following expression for \(Z\):</p> \[Z = A e^{i(\omega t - kr)} \times \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} e^{- i m \delta}\] <p>We now have two cases. The first is when \(\delta = kd \sin \theta = 2 \pi n\), with \(n\) integer. Then, \(e^{- i m \delta} = 1\) and the sum on the right hand side evaluates to \(N\), meaning that \(Z = A N e^{i(\omega t - kr)}\), and we have points of maximum intensity. The second case is when \(\delta \neq 2 \pi n\). Then the right-hand side is a geometric sequence, which we can sum as:</p> \[\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} e^{- i m \delta} = \frac{1 - e^{- i N \delta}}{1 - e^{- i \delta} }\] <p>In the second case, the geometric sequence will evaluate to zero whenever \(\delta = kd \sin \theta = \frac{2 \pi p}{N}\), with \(p \in \{1, 2, ..., N-1 \}\). Therefore, we get \(N-1\) minima between each \(\delta = 2 \pi n\) maxima, and smaller <em>subsidiary</em> maxima (of which there are \(N - 2\)) between each minima. This is completely in agreement with what you have been told in your lectures.</p> <p>Again, we could have worked this out through a diagram, by joining together \(N\) arrows each displaced by an angle of \(\delta\). When the angle \(\delta\) is a multiple of \(2 \pi\), all of the arrows are in parallel hence we get constructive interference and an overall arrow of length \(AN\). On the other hand, if \(\delta = \frac{2 \pi p}{N}\), once we have joined all of the arrows together we are back at the origin, i.e. the resulting phasor has zero length and we are at a minimum. The corresponding diagram then forms a regular polygon with the exterior angles equal to \(\delta = \frac{2 \pi p}{N}\).</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-4-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-4-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-4-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="60%" height="60%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p> </p> <h4 id="diffraction-gratings-in-the-n-rightarrow-infty-limit">Diffraction Gratings in the \(N \rightarrow \infty\) Limit</h4> <p>We can use the result for the finite \(N\) diffraction grating to obtain two further expressions – one when the number of slits gets very large (i.e. \(N \rightarrow \infty\), but their spacing \(d\) is kept constant), and another when the number of slits gets infinitely large and the slits get infinitely small (\(N \rightarrow \infty\) with \(d \rightarrow 0\), which will turn out to be the slit of finite width). Here, you have to be <em>EXTREMELY CAREFUL</em>, because the two limits correspond to <em>physically distinct</em> phenomena – it would be flat out wrong to say that a diffraction by a grating with very many spacings is the same as single-slit diffraction!</p> <p>For the \(N \rightarrow \infty\), \(d\) constant case notice that the angular displacement between the central \(\delta = 0\) maximum and its closest \(\delta = kd \sin \theta = \frac{2 \pi }{N}\) minimum is \(\Delta \theta = \frac{2 \pi}{N}\), which gives us the width of the maxima (proportional to \(\frac{1}{N}\)). We can also see that the intensity of the \(\delta = \frac{2 \pi p}{N}\) maxima goes as \(\| Z \|^2 \propto N^2\). We can therefore say that as \(N \rightarrow \infty\), the maxima become sharper (their width approaches \(0\)), and their intensities is much larger than those of the subsidiary maxima. So in this limit, the pattern tends towards sharp points at \(kd \sin \theta = 2 \pi n\) with no maxima inbetween.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-5-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-5-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-5-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="80%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p> </p> <p>For the other case, we will make the diffraction gratings spaces very small, and set \(d = \frac{a}{N-1}\) (where \(a\) is the overall width of the ‘grating’). Each wave will also have an amplitude of \(A =\frac{A_{\text{max}}}{N}\). The overall phase difference between the top and bottom of the grating is given by \(\phi = (N-1) \delta = k a \sin \theta\). There are \(N\) spacings overall, and our expression for \(\| Z \|\) is given by:</p> \[\| Z \| = \left\| \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{N} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{- i \phi m}{N-1} } \right\|\] <p>Let’s take the \(N \rightarrow \infty\) limit of this. Then, we can approximate the sum by an integral, as follows:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \| Z \| &amp;\simeq \left\| \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{N} \int_{0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{- i \phi x }{N-1} } dx \right\| \\ &amp; \simeq \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{N} \frac{N - 1}{\phi} \| e^{- i \phi} - 1 \| \\ &amp; \simeq \frac{N-1}{N} \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{\phi} \sqrt{(e^{- i \phi} - 1) (e^{i \phi} - 1)} \\ &amp; \simeq \frac{N-1}{N} \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{\phi} \sqrt{2 - e^{i \phi} - e^{-i \phi} } \\ &amp; \simeq \frac{N-1}{N} \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{\phi} \sqrt{2 - 2 \cos \phi } \\ &amp; \simeq \frac{N-1}{N} \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{\phi} \sqrt{4 \sin^2 (\frac{\phi}{2}) } \\ &amp; \simeq \frac{N-1}{N} \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{\phi / 2} \sin (\frac{\phi}{2}) \end{aligned}\] <p>If we now square this and take the limit of \(N \rightarrow \infty\), we finally obtain:</p> \[I (\theta) \simeq \left( \frac{A_{\text{max}}}{\phi / 2} \sin (\frac{\phi}{2}) \right)^2 \simeq A_{\text{max}}^2 \text{sinc}^2(\frac{\phi}{2})\] <p>Which again is the expression for single slit diffraction (of width \(a\)) which you have seen in your lectures! Again, this approach is complimentary to the method using phasors given in the handout. In the graphical method, we have also split the slit of finite width into infinitely many point sources of infitesimal size (the diagram then tends towards an arc of a circle), and used geometry to find the length \(\| Z \|\) of the resulting phasor.</p> <p>We can see the convergence clearly with <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/u5jr61cerf">these animations</a>, which I made on Desmos:</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-8.gif-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-8.gif-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-8.gif-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-8.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="80%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-9.gif-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-9.gif-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-9.gif-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-9.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="80%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p> </p> <h4 id="diffraction-patterns-via-integration">Diffraction Patterns via Integration</h4> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-6-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-6-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-6-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="80%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p> </p> <p>We will first consider a slit of width \(a\) with a midpoint \(C\) on the diagram, and split it up into point sources of width \(\delta x\). We will then define our ‘amplitude per unit length’ to be \(A = \frac{A_\text{max}}{a}\) so that each wave emanating from a point source has an amplitude of \(A \delta x\). Relative to the midpoint, each contribution from the point source between \(x + \delta x\) and \(x\) is given by \(A\delta x \times \cos (\omega t - k (r + x \sin \theta))\), where \(r\) is the distance from \(C\) to the point \(P\) on the screen. We can write each contribution as a phasor:</p> \[\delta Z = A e^{i(\omega t - kx - kx \sin \theta)} \delta x = A e^{i(\omega t - kx)} e^{- i k x \sin \theta} \delta x\] <p>Summing up all of these contributions (for \(-a/2 \leq x \leq a/2\)) will therefore amount to computing an integral, given by:</p> \[\begin{aligned} Z &amp;= A e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \int^{a/2}_{-a/2} e^{- i k x \sin \theta} dx \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \frac{iA_\text{max}}{ka \sin \theta} (e^{- \frac{1}{2} i k a \sin \theta} - e^{ \frac{1}{2} i k a \sin \theta}) \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \frac{iA_\text{max}}{\phi} \times -2i \sin (\frac{\phi}{2}) \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} A_\text{max} \text{sinc} ( \frac{\phi}{2} ) \end{aligned}\] <p>Where we have written the overall phase difference between the top and bottom of the slit as \(\phi = k a \sin \theta\). This is the correct expression for the amplitude, giving \(I(\theta) = A^2_\text{max} \text{sinc}^2 ( \frac{\phi}{2} )\).</p> <p>We can use this method to derive the diffraction pattern for the case of two slits, each of width \(a\), with midpoints separated by a distance \(d\). The midpoints of the top and bottom slits lie at \(x = \pm\frac{d}{2}\). We will therefore have contributions of waves from two regions: the top slit, where \(\frac{d}{2} + \frac{a}{2} \geq x \geq \frac{d}{2} - \frac{a}{2}\), and the bottom slit where \(-\frac{d}{2} + \frac{a}{2} \geq x \geq -\frac{d}{2} - \frac{a}{2}\). Since the combined width of the slits is \(2a\), we will set \(A = \frac{A_\text{max}}{2a}\). We then need to integrate over those contributions, to obtain:</p> \[\begin{aligned} Z &amp;= A e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \left( \int^{d/2 + a/2}_{d/2 -a/2} e^{- i k x \sin \theta} dx + \int^{-d/2 + a/2}_{-d/2 -a/2} e^{- i k x \sin \theta} dx \right) \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \frac{iA_\text{max}}{2ka \sin \theta} \left( e^{- i k \sin \theta (d/2 + a/2)} - e^{- i k \sin \theta (d/2 - a/2)} + e^{i k \sin \theta (d/2 - a/2)} - e^{i k \sin \theta (d/2 + a/2)} \right) \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \frac{iA_\text{max}}{2ka \sin \theta} \left( -2i \sin (k \sin \theta (d/2 + a/2)) + 2i \sin (k \sin \theta (d/2 - a/2)) \right) \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \frac{A_\text{max}}{ka \sin \theta} \left( \sin (k \sin \theta (d/2 + a/2)) - \sin (k \sin \theta (d/2 - a/2)) \right) \end{aligned}\] <p>At this point, we want to apply the identity \(\sin \alpha - \sin \beta = 2 \cos (\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}) \sin (\frac{\alpha - \beta}{2})\). This will yield:</p> \[\begin{aligned} Z &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \frac{2A_\text{max}}{ka \sin \theta} \cos (\frac{k d \sin \theta}{2} ) \sin (\frac{k a \sin \theta}{2} ) \\ &amp;= e^{i(\omega t - kx)} \times A_\text{max} \cos (\frac{k d \sin \theta}{2} ) \text{sinc} (\frac{k a \sin \theta}{2} ) \end{aligned}\] <p>Which is the exact same expression as before, modulated by the factor of \(\cos (\frac{k d \sin \theta}{2} )\)! Overall, we get the following expression for intensity:</p> \[I(\theta) = A^2_\text{max} \cos^2 (\frac{k d \sin \theta}{2} ) \text{sinc}^2 (\frac{k a \sin \theta}{2} )\] <p> </p> <p>Finally, let’s relate our answer to Question 18 (b) from your problem sheets. There, we had a single slit of width \(a\), for which the middle third was blocked. We were asked to describe the resulting diffraction pattern:</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-7-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-7-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diffraction-7-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diffraction-7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="90%" height="90%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>From the above discussion it should be clear that the pattern for part (a) is given by the the single-slit intensity. In the second part, we can make use of our newly derived expressions. Since a third of the single slit is blocked, we obtain a double slit of width \(a \rightarrow \frac{a}{3}\), with the distance between the midpoints of the two slits being \(d \rightarrow \frac{2a}{3}\). Substituting this in, the exact formula for the resulting diffraction pattern intensity is given by (taking \(\phi = \frac{ka \sin \theta}{3}\)):</p> \[I(\theta) = A^2_\text{max} \cos^2 (\frac{k a \sin \theta}{3} ) \text{sinc}^2 (\frac{k a \sin \theta}{6} ) = A^2_\text{max} \cos^2 ( \phi ) \text{sinc}^2 (\frac{\phi}{2} )\] <p>Which my students may recognise as the formula we derived in the supervision :-)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[ ]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Identifying Statistical Irregularities in the 2024 Georgian Parliamentary Elections</title><link href="https://jedbur.github.io/blog/2024/georgian-elections/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Identifying Statistical Irregularities in the 2024 Georgian Parliamentary Elections"/><published>2024-10-29T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-29T18:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jedbur.github.io/blog/2024/georgian-elections</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jedbur.github.io/blog/2024/georgian-elections/"><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>The 2024 Georgian Parliamentary elections were held last Saturday, October 26th. Since the moment polls opened, numerous accounts of malpractice have been reported: international observers have identified instances of vote-buying, ballot stuffing, election carousels, as well as intimidation and violence against the observers themselves. The opposition party and president Salome Zourabichvili have denied the results, and called for a re-run of the elections and an investigation into the irregularities. The ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party maintains everything was carried out fairly and honestly.</p> <p>Very often, fraudulent elections can be identified through various statistical ‘fingerprints’ in the reported results. The Georgian Central Election Comission (CEC) has made the results publically available, and there has been some excellent analysis done already; one popular observation (first made by Roman Udot <a href="https://x.com/romanik_/status/1850634786018066728">here</a> and Levan Kvirkvelia <a href="https://x.com/LevanKvirkvelia/status/1850761181599858792">here</a>) is that the distribution of support for the ruling party (expressed as the % of votes cast going to GD) across polling stations is almost – but not quite – a normal distribution, with a ‘tail’ in the high-GD-support end of the curve: a pattern which suggests an abnormally high number of strongly pro-GD polling results. This is <a href="https://x.com/romanik_/status/1850634766279962994">especially prominent</a> when the data from rural areas is isolated, i.e. polling stations from big cities like Tbilisi, Batumi or Kutaisi are excluded. By no coincidence, such rural regions are exactly where the majority of electoral fraud reports have come from. This is pretty much in line with what has been reported by independent observers, and I highly recommend reading the original threads for more details.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ge2024-1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="80%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Source: <a href="https://x.com/EuropeElects/status/1851183540991406458"> Europe Elects on X/Twitter. </a> </div> <p>Intrigued by the discrepancies in rural &amp; urban electoral data I have carried out some further analysis, to see if we can infer anything else. The electoral dataset I used is available <a href="https://www.electoral.graphics/en-us/Elections-and-Datasets/Navigator-for-Elections/with-datasets/georgia-the-parliament-2024">here</a>, and the code I used to make the plots is available <a href="https://github.com/jedbur/ge2024/">here</a>. I am neither a statistician nor a data scientist, however the beauty of plots is that those more experienced than me can use them to draw their own conclusions.</p> <p> </p> <h3 id="government-support-vs-turnout">Government support vs. turnout</h3> <p>Scatter plots of ruling party support against turnout are one common way of identifying signs of voter fraud. To make one, take the reported results from every polling station, and plot each report as a dot, with voter turnout (votes cast / registered voters) on the \(x\)-axis, and ruling party support (votes for the ruling party / votes cast) on the \(y\)-axis.</p> <p>In a fair election, we would typically expect no correlation between the two – the proportion of votes each party gets should be (on average) the same regardless of how many people came out to vote in a particular constituency. However, observing a positive correlation between the two could suggest fraud took place: if a candidate is stuffing boxes or sending people to vote multiple times, this will raise the turnout rate in the affected polling stations. Since the additional votes then mostly go to the cheating candidate, their support rate also increases. This technique has been used, for example, in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1210722109">this political science paper</a> (as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00936.x">this one</a>) to detect systematic irregularities in elections. In the case of Russian elections, there is an additional artefact in the scatter plots. The below graphic from the Economist shows that on top of the strong turnout-support correlation, the scatter plot of two decades’ worth of Russian electoral data features prominent ‘gridlines’, suggesting that polling stations systematically make up the reported vote totals to fit predetermined rates of turnout and support.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ge2024-3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ge2024-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="120%" height="120%" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left: Figure taken from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1210722109">Klimek, Yegorov, Hanel, Thurner (2012). </a> Right: Figure by <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/11/russian-elections-once-again-had-a-suspiciously-neat-result"> The Economist. </a> </div> <p> </p> <h4 id="georgia-2024">Georgia 2024</h4> <p>We can look for similar ‘comet’ patterns in the Georgian electoral data.

Usually, they are explainable through other phenomena observed around the election. In the case of Georgia, however, these patterns combined with the numerous reports of fraud seem to form a consistent story: <strong><em>it looks like Georgian Dream has been artificially inflating their vote share in rural areas.</em></strong></p> <p> </p> <h3 id="benfords-law">Benford’s Law</h3> <p>Another way to look for irregularities in election data is to check whether it abides by Benford’s Law. This is a statistical rule that many naturally occuring datasets follow, and it states that the leading (leftmost) digits of numbers in the dataset appear with specific probabilities (\(P(d) = \log_{10} ( 1 + 1/d)\) where \(1 \leq d \leq 9\) is the leading digit). In checking whether the Georgian electoral data obeys this, I largely followed <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-tested-the-hungarian-election-for-fraud-using-benfords-law-2d32ea92fe7c">this blogpost</a> by Jens Ringsholm who tested the Hungarian election for fraud. Because voting numbers from individual polling stations tend to be quite small (Benford’s law requires that the relevant data spans several orders of magnitude), I aggregated the CEC polling data by the District ID, and tallied the leading digit in the total vote count for each party for each district. The overall result is below:</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-12-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-12-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-12-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ge2024-12.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="100%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>As before, we can also compare the results from urban and rural areas:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-10-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-10-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-10-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ge2024-10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-11-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-11-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/ge2024-11-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ge2024-11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>It mostly looks like the data follows Benford’s Law.

This does not rule out fraud, and in fact ballot stuffing can in principle lead to a ‘naturally’ distributed dataset. On the other hand, there seems to be something strange going on in urban areas, where second digits ‘1’ and ‘4’ are severely overrepresented, whilst ‘3’, ‘5’ and ‘7’ are underrepresented. In my view, with 318 data points this is not necessarily a statistical fluke. It is far beyond my expertise to investigate it further, but I hope somebody with experience will take a better look.</p> <p> </p> <p>Again, I am not a researcher, but I hope the above manages to raise awareness about what’s going on in Georgia, and that it might inspire others to take a closer look at the rural vs. urban trends. Jupyter notebooks used to make the plots are freely available on my <a href="https://github.com/jedbur/ge2024/">github</a>; doing significance tests of the above findings might be a good way to proceed further.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[ ]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Optimising Projection Angles, with Cliffs</title><link href="https://jedbur.github.io/blog/2023/projection-angles-cliffs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Optimising Projection Angles, with Cliffs"/><published>2023-12-12T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-12T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jedbur.github.io/blog/2023/projection-angles-cliffs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jedbur.github.io/blog/2023/projection-angles-cliffs/"><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><em>A gun fires a shell with velocity</em> \(v\) <em>at an angle</em> \(\theta\) <em>to the horizontal. What is launch angle maximising the horizontal distance travelled?</em></p> <p>This is a common question, which every physics student does at some point when first learning classical mechanics. I teach it to first years, and vaguely remember doing some variant of it during my undergraduate degree. Once you do enough classic physics problems, they form something like a trope, which you recall when doing unseen ones. And so, when going through the 2022 PAT exam with one of my students last summer, Question 15 (a) struck me as an interesting variation of the common projectile physics trope:</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/PAT22Q15-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/PAT22Q15-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/PAT22Q15-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PAT22Q15.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="90%" height="90%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Having never previously considered the angle problem for a projectile launched off a cliff, I became curious if the optimal angle would change. In the original case, it is 45 degrees, but intuitively it didn’t’t seem it’d be the same with a cliff. Say you’re standing on one, throwing a stone into the sea: with a massive height difference between the points of throwing and landing, a larger component of horizontal velocity seems to make more of a difference than the little air time you’d gain from a larger vertical component. So as the initial height increases, we’d expect the optimal angle to tend towards zero. It turns out this problem can still be solved to give a simple formula, and the solution is straightforward, though tedious, yet satisfying. Inspired by Q15, I’ve reformulated the optimal angle problem as follows:</p> <hr/> <p><em>A gun fires a shell with fixed speed at the muzzle of</em> \(v\) \(ms^{-1}\)<em>, at an angle of elevation</em> \(\theta\) <em>which can be varied. The shell explodes on impact with the ground, which is horizontal. The gun is positioned at a height</em> \(H\) <em>relative to the ground. Find the optimal angle</em> \(\theta_{H}\) <em>required for a maximum horizontal distance</em> \(x_f\) <em>travelled by the shell, as a function of</em> \(H\) <em>and</em> \(v\).</p> <hr/> <p>To do this question, we will use SUVAT to model the motion of the projectile in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, with \(t\) as a parameter:</p> \[\begin{aligned} x(t, \theta) &amp;= v_x t &amp; y(t, \theta) &amp;= v_y t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \nonumber \\ &amp;= v \cos \theta \cdot t &amp; &amp;= v \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \nonumber \end{aligned}\] <p>We can substitute one into the other to get \(y\) as a function of \(x, \theta\):</p> \[y(x, \theta) = x \tan \theta - \frac{g x^2 }{2 v^2} \sec ^2 \theta. \nonumber\] <p>The projectile starts at height \(H\), however it’s easier to position the origin of the coordinate system at this height. So upon impact, the \(y\)-coordinate is \(-H\):</p> \[-H = x_f \tan \theta - \frac{g x_f^2 }{2 v^2} \sec ^2 \theta. \nonumber\] <p>We will solve for \(x\) as a general function of \(y, \theta\) first. To do this, we rearrange the expression for \(y(x, \theta)\) and solve the quadratic:</p> \[x^2 - x \cdot \frac{2v^2}{g} \sin \theta \cos \theta + \frac{2v^2 y}{g} \cos^2 \theta = 0.\] <p>As you can see, the algebra gets nasty here - time to roll up our sleeves, grind our teeth and use the quadratic formula:</p> \[\begin{aligned} x &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2v^2}{g} \sin \theta \cos \theta \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{2v^2}{g} \right)^2 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta - \frac{8v^2y}{g} \cos^2 \theta } \right) \nonumber \\ &amp;= \frac{v^2 \cos\theta}{g} \left( \sin \theta \pm \sqrt{ \sin^2 \theta - \frac{2gy}{v^2} } \right). \nonumber \end{aligned}\] <p>This is the horizontal distance as a function of vertical distance and angle along the trajectory. Now, let’s substitute \(y = -H\), \(x = x_f\) into this equation:</p> \[x_f = \frac{v^2 \cos\theta}{g} \left( \sin \theta \pm \sqrt{ \sin^2 \theta + \frac{2gH}{v^2} } \right).\] <p>Before proceeding further, let’s re-evaluate - some `sanity checks’ are in order:</p> <ul> <li>First, the expression inside of the square root is always positive and greater than \(\sin^2 \theta\), so one of the values of \(x_f\) will be negative. This corresponds to a time-reversed motion of the projectile, or equivalently to motion with projection velocity \(-v\)</li> <li>If \(H=0\) then the projectile is launched level to the landing, so \(x_f = v^2 \sin 2 \theta / g\) or \(0\). The first solution is maximised at 45 degrees, and the second tells us that the projectile touches the ground at the start of its journey. \(x_f\) behaves like we expect it to, which is good.</li> </ul> <p>Now suppose we hold \(H\) fixed, and wish to find the \(\theta\) that maximises horizontal distance. To do this, we maximise \(x_f\) whilst treating \(H\) as a constant (we use the positive root, since \(x_f &gt; 0\)). Get ready to differentiate:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \frac{d x_f}{d \theta} &amp;= - \frac{v^2 \sin \theta}{g} \left( \sin \theta + \sqrt{ \sin^2 \theta + \frac{2gH}{v^2} } \right) + \frac{v^2 \cos \theta}{g} \left( \cos \theta + \frac{\sin \theta \cos \theta}{\sqrt{ \sin^2 \theta + \frac{2gH}{v^2} }} \right) \nonumber \\ &amp;= 0. \nonumber \end{aligned}\] <p>To make things easier, we will write \(\alpha = 2gH/v^2\). We then divide by \(-v^2/g\), and move the second term to the RHS. After factorising in terms of \(\sin \theta\), \(\cos \theta\), we get:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \sin^2 \theta \left( 1 + \sqrt{ 1 + \alpha \ \text{cosec}^2 \theta } \right) &amp;= \cos^2 \theta \left( 1 + \frac{\sin \theta}{\sqrt{ \sin^2 \theta + \alpha }} \right) \nonumber \\ &amp;= \cos^2 \theta \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1 + \alpha \ \text{cosec}^2 \theta }} \right) \nonumber \\ &amp;= \cos^2 \theta \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{ 1 + \alpha \ \text{cosec}^2 \theta } }{\sqrt{ 1 + \alpha \ \text{cosec}^2 \theta }} \right). \nonumber \end{aligned}\] <p>Which we rearrange to get:</p> \[\tan^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \alpha \ \text{cosec}^2 \theta}}.\] <p>We are not done yet. We square both sides and use the trig identity \(1 + \text{cot}^2 \theta = \text{cosec}^2 \theta\), to get:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \tan^4 \theta (1 + \alpha \ \text{cosec}^2 \theta ) &amp;= (1 + \alpha) \tan^4 \theta + \alpha \tan^2 \theta \nonumber \\ &amp;= 1. \nonumber \end{aligned}\] <p>Which gives another quadratic:</p> \[\tan^4 \theta + \left( \frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha} \right) \tan^2 \theta - \frac{1}{1 + \alpha} = 0.\] <p>Solving this one gives two solutions:</p> \[\tan \theta = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha}, -\frac{1}{2}\] <p>We discard the negative root, finally giving us:</p> \[\theta_H = \arctan \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 + 2gH/v^2}},\] <p>which for \(H=0\) gives 45 degrees, and as \(H \rightarrow \infty, \theta_H \rightarrow 0\). Nice.</p> <hr/> <p>I was genuinely surprised that the solution turned out so simple. The real fun of this question, however, comes from graphing what’s going on. I have done this on Desmos, and you can play around with it by following <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hwtcoqq8e1">this link</a>. You can adjust the sliders for the initial height, speed and projection angle, and see how the trajectory of the object changes. The dashed lines represent the initial direction of velocity: grey is the 45 degree projection, whereas purple is the optimal angle for a given \(H, v\). The horizontal blue line marks the maximum \(x_f\), as worked out in the solution above.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/desmos.gif-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/desmos.gif-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/desmos.gif-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/desmos.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="90%" height="90%" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building on a common physics problem]]></summary></entry></feed>
