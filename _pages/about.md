I am a 3rd year PhD Student at St John's College, Cambridge working at the [Cavendish Laboratory Quantum Information Group](https://www.qi.phy.cam.ac.uk). I am co-supervised by [Sergii Strelchuk](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/sergii.strelchuk/) (now at Oxford Computer Science) and [Crispin Barnes](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/barnesc).

My interests mainly lie at the intersection of quantum computing and group theory. This includes computational models such as matchgates or permutational quantum computing (PQC), and quantum algorithm primitives like the Schur transform & their applications. Alongside my PhD I am also a part-time researcher at [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com), where I work on quantum computational chemistry. You may find my list of publications [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2917155).

I was born in Krakow, and have lived in the UK since 2011. Prior to my PhD I attended Brasenose College, Oxford where I obtained a BA in Physics & Philosophy followed by an MSc in Mathematical & Theoretical Physics.

Aside from my research I supervise the Physics IA course at Emmanuel College, as well as the Mathematics Part II course in Quantum Information and Computation. I also [offer private tutoring](/tutoring)!
